# -Machine-Learning-Models-For-Predicting-Stock-Prices

This is a Model that uses Logistic regression, Reinforced neural networks, K-means clustering to predict stock prices for Amazon
•Deployed three genetic algorithms for predicting stock prices and optimized their performance using various Machine Learning models and TensorFlow libraries.
•I also streamlined the data processing and manipulation using Pandas data frames and PostgreSQL with the help of SQLAlchemy. To make the data more understandable, I used Matplotlib and Plotly to reorganize it into digestible pieces.
•Tools I utilized for this project include Machine Learning, Python, Django, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, SQLAlchemy, and yfinance

The Machine Learning models successfully predicted the stock prices with a R-squared value of 0.8, which is a fairly good measure of success:
